Currently, there are numerous temperature prediction models in the world. By utilizing machine learning techniques, we can analyze historical time series data and forecast temperatures with high accuracy. This project focuses on developing a temperature forecasting system using time series models and deep learning models based on temperature data from Ho Chi Minh City.

Our objective is to build daily temperature prediction models and compare their performance, including SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks), and DFNN (Deep Fuzzy Neural Networks). The criteria for comparing these models include accuracy and their ability to handle the collected dataset.

The research results will help us understand the effectiveness and limitations of each model in temperature prediction applications. We hope that this report can provide accurate and reliable temperature forecasting methods to assist in decision-making and selection based on temperature forecasts and predictions.
